@article{Vasconcelos2011,
	abstract = {In this work a new algorithm is derived for the onboard calibration of three-axis strapdown magnetometers. The proposed calibration method is written in the sensor frame, and compensates for the combined effect of all linear time-invariant distortions, namely soft iron, hard iron, sensor nonorthogonality, and bias, among others. A maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is formulated to iteratively find the optimal calibration parameters that best fit to the onboard sensor readings, without requiring external attitude references. It is shown that the proposed calibration technique is equivalent to the estimation of a rotation, scaling and translation transformation, and that the sensor alignment matrix is given by the solution of the orthogonal Procrustes problem. Good initial conditions for the iterative algorithm are obtained by a suboptimal batch least squares computation. Simulation and experimental results with low-cost sensors data are presented and discussed, supporting the application of the algorithm to autonomous vehicles and other robotic platforms.},

@article{Pylvanainen2008,
	abstract = {Embedded sensors are an emerging trend in mobile consumer devices. Calibration of the sensors in this environment can be prohibitively difficult for the user. We propose an automatic calibration algorithm that can be used for any three-dimensional sensor sensing some external field. In particular, it is suitable for calibrating a three-axis magnetometer. The algorithm is based on recursive fitting of an ellipsoid to collected samples from the sensor. It can adaptively update the calibration parameters and is completely invisible to the user.},

@techreport{Madgwick2010_report,
	abstract = {This report presents a novel orientation filter applicable to IMUs consisting of tri-axis gyroscopes and accelerometers, and MARG sensor arrays that also include tri-axis magnetometers. The MARG implementation incorporates magnetic distortion and gyroscope bias drift compensation. The filter uses a quaternion representation, allowing accelerometer and magnetometer data to be used in an analytically derived and optimised gradient-descent algorithm to compute the direction of the gyroscope measurement error as a quaternion derivative. The benefits of the filter include: (1) computationally inexpensive; requiring 109 (IMU) or 277 (MARG) scalar arithmetic operations each filter update, (2) effective at low sampling rates; e.g. 10 Hz, and (3) contains 1 (IMU) or 2 (MARG) adjustable parameters defined by observable system characteristics. Performance was evaluated empirically using a commercially available orientation sensor and reference measurements of orientation obtained using an optical measurement system. A simple calibration method is presented for the use of the optical measurement equipment in this application. Performance was also benchmarked against the propriety Kalman-based algorithm of orientation sensor. Results indicate the filter achieves levels of accuracy exceeding that of the Kalman-based algorithm; {\textless} 0.6◦ static RMS error, {\textless} 0.8◦ dynamic RMS error. The implications of the low computational load and ability to operate at low sampling rates open new opportunities for the use of IMU and MARG sensor arrays in real-time applications of limited power or processing resources or applications that demand extremely high sampling rates.},

@techreport{Woodman2007,
	abstract = {Until recently the weight and size of inertial sensors has prohibited their use in domains such as human motion capture. Recent improvements in the performance of small and lightweight micromachined electromechanical systems (MEMS) inertial sensors have made the application of inertial techniques to such problems possible. This has resulted in an increased interest in the topic of inertial navigation, however current introductions to the subject fail to sufficiently describe the error characteristics of inertial systems. We introduce inertial navigation, focusing on strapdown systems based on MEMS devices. A combination of measurement and simulation is used to explore the error characteristics of such systems. For a simple inertial navigation system (INS) based on the Xsens Mtx inertial measurement unit (IMU), we show that the average error in position grows to over 150 m after 60 seconds of operation. The propagation of orientation errors caused by noise perturbing gyroscope signals is identified as the critical cause of such drift. By simulation we examine the significance of individual noise processes perturbing the gyroscope signals, identifying white noise as the process which contributes most to the overall drift of the system. Sensor fusion and domain specific constraints can be used to reduce drift in INSs. For an example INS we show that sensor fusion using magnetometers can reduce the average error in position obtained by the system after 60 seconds from over 150 m to around 5 m. We conclude that whilst MEMS IMU technology is rapidly improving, it is not yet possible to build a MEMS based INS which gives sub-meter position accuracy for more than one minute of operation.},
