The controller available to use is the \href{https://www.maxonmotor.com/maxon/view/product/control/Positionierung/300583}{Maxon EPOS 70/10}, from now on denoted as EPOS. It includes CAN network interface and a RS-232. The relevant electrical specs can be seen in table \ref{tab:epos_specs}. The full specifications as well as connections layout must be seen in \cite{epos_hardware}. The controller contains two led in a single package that is used as status reference.

\section{Steering sensor support}
Maxon EPOS 70/10 accepts quadrature sensors to give feedback of position. The used sensor is a quadrature line driver with index (although index is disabled because its track is damaged). The sensor model is HEDR-55L2-BY09 with main characteristics shown in table \ref{tab:quad_sensor} \cite{hedr_sensor}. Table \ref{tab:quad_sensor_settings} show the required configuration to be passed to EPOS device to correctly use the steering controller. See appendix \ref{appendix:maxon} for further description.

The sensor support is mainly 3D printed in ABS filament. It is composed of the following parts presented in table \ref{tab:sensor_support_parts}.
A dimensional sketch of the sensor and bearing used was also designed just for auxiliary purposes and to provide assembly instructions. The drawings with respective dimensions are added in appendix \ref{appendix:sensor_drawings}. The parts were designed in Autodesk Fusion 360 and are available under the Github repository

\section{Calibration process}
Here is assumed the vehicle follows a model of Ackermann steering model typical valid for low speed which result in the simplified approximation of the single line model or as in general described in literature, as bicycle model\cite{Snider2009} \cite{Navigation_System_Design}. A simplified representation of the model is present in figure \ref{fig:ackermann_steering}. This model is normally used in control applications and expected to be used in future high level control. As it is necessary to determine the angle of wheel with respect to body frame YY axis (recall subsection \ref{subsection:body_frame}), the first calibration process required is to determine the function relating steering wheel position and angle of fictional wheel. A set up was made fixing the car and placing a white duck tape in front of it, perpendicular as physically possible and apart by 1.47 meters in front of the car. The duck tape will serve as a ruler. In each wheel is attached a laser level, pointing to front duck tape. Several measurements are take for different steering position values and using trigonometric relations, the angles of each wheel is estimated. 

The other calibration process is taken each time a power up is made. It consists in performing a full rotation of the steering wheel to each extreme points. During this movement, the program is always reading sensor position and updating the maximum and minimum value read. After these quadrature counter values are found, user is requested to end calibration and the offset are calculated and stored along with maximum and minimum position. These values will only change in case of shut down performed on steering controller device.

Taking figure \ref{fig:calibration_scheme} that represents the calibration set up made, the bold line between points $max_L$ and $max_R$ represent the our ruler. The $d1$ represent the distance between outer of each wheel where the lasers are attached. The relevant distances using in this step up are present in table \ref{tab:calibration_scheme}.

Comparing figure \ref{fig:ackermann_steering} with figure \ref{fig:calibration_scheme} results in \eqref{eq:steeting_cal}. Then is assumed that:
\begin{itemize}
	\tightlist
	\item $\gamma$ must be a first order function.
	\item $\delta \gamma$ must be always great or equal to zero and therefore, quadratic.
	\item $\beta$ and $\alpha$ should be, at least a second order function with opposite concavities orientation.
\end{itemize}

\begin{equation}
\centering
\left \lbrace \begin{aligned}
\beta &= \gamma + \delta \gamma\\
\alpha&= \gamma - \delta \gamma
